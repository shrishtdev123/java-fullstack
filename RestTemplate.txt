 Communication Between microservices:

 1.First way and more friendly:

       ===RestTemplate====
    1. if we want to establish communication between services then we should go for restTemplate 
    2.RestTemplate is buildin class which contain several method to make http request from one service to other services
    3.first we will create bean of RestTemplate then we autowired or use constructor for use of this where we need it
      for getRequest:
    4.if we want to getsome things from the other service into other service then we should use getForObject(url,x.class) method
    5.it contain two parameter first is url means endpoint from where we want to fetch data and second is the type casting type means in which formate data is comming:
   
   
   ===Post request ======

    if we want to send some data from one service to other then we should go for postForEntity(url,requestBody,x.class) method 
    this method contain three parameter which is very important and always need ,first is the url ,second is data which we want to send and third is 
    typecasting means in which formate we are sending data

 ====Put request=====
   if we want to update some things from Service A to Service B then we should go for put(url,body) 

=====Delete request=====
   if we want to delete then we should go for delete Method of restTemplate okay right 


all the above method used to send the request in the from of curd okay right 

===Step to create RestTemplate Bean=====

 1.  @Bean
   public RestTemplate restTemplate(){
   
         return new RestTemplate ();
    }


 2. now where you want to use this we have to use Autowired to use the above method which we disccuss okay right

 
Example:
    Let us consider we have two services order and payment okay right,they are run on the differnet port number say 8001 and 8002 respectively
   
    inside the order service we have endpoint like that 
     localhost:8001/create-order, method is post which is used to crerate order 
   
     when some hite this particular link then a new order is created okay right after the order created we have to call the payment service right 

    step to from order to payment:
     1.hite the  localhost:8001/create-order ,order is created 
     2.save in the database order
     3.now we want to provide the payment service to the user ,so we call the payment service 
         
        step to call the payment service:
        1.create the bean of RestTemplate 
        2.use the RestTemplate object to use the method 
    
       Paymeny payment=restTemplate.postEntity(url,body,Order.class)
      
       Order class should exit in both class means data formate should be same
