video-3(Session-3)(Service Registry): 

Service Registry:
     1)it is a centralized Registry of all Micro Services of an Application
     2) it collects each microservices information and maitains internally.
     3) for implementing this we have Eureka Server provided Netflix.

Service Registry application:
---------------------------------
1.Create new Spring Boot application Add Eureka Server Starter and finish it.

2.Add an annotation in main Spring Boot application class level.//@EnableEurekaServer

3.add port number 8761 for service registry application always.
          
            spring.application.name=amzon-service-registry
            server.port=8761
4.Start application :
       
          Started 8761 port number
          but with some exception:
  -> By defult service registry serve Application itself registering as a client appication own its own
  -> In this case we can stop this default behaviour.
       Stopping Registering its as client once again
  
 
5.Once Service registry Application started,we will get always a default UI portal
          localhost:8761

->by default our micro services are not going to register with Service Registery application
->make our services aslo as discovery clients
->
